# Magic 8 Ball

Magic 8 Ball developed in C#. Provides random answers with Images to your questions. This was probably one of the simplest applications to 
date. I acquired a set of the images online that I was able to use and really its as simple as calling the random class and adding a switch 
statement for the image. Pressing the ask button calls a random image from the resources folder.
